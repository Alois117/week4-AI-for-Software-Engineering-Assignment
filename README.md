# ðŸ¤– AI in Software Engineering â€“ Week 4 Assignment

This repository contains my submission for Week 4 of the AI in Software Engineering course, focused on the theme **"Building Intelligent Software Solutions."**

## âœ… Project Overview

This project demonstrates how AI tools can:
- Automate software development tasks
- Improve testing and deployment efficiency
- Enable predictive analytics for smarter decision-making
- Promote ethical AI development

## ðŸ”§ Tasks Overview

### 1. AI-Powered Code Completion (GitHub Copilot)
- **Goal:** Sort a list of dictionaries using both AI-suggested and manual methods.
- **File:** `sort_dict_comparison.py`
- **Result:** AI-generated code using Python's `sorted()` proved more efficient and maintainable than manual bubble sort.

### 2. Automated Testing with AI (Selenium)
- **Goal:** Automate login page testing for valid/invalid credentials.
- **File:** `task2.py`
- **Result:** 2/2 test cases passed. Screenshot provided.

### 3. Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation
- **Dataset:** Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset (`breast-cancer.csv`)
- **Goal:** Predict issue priority (high/low) using a Random Forest model.
- **File:** Included in notebook format or Python script.
- **Metrics:**
  - Accuracy: `96.5%`
  - F1 Score: `96.5%`

## ðŸ§  Ethical Reflection

The modelâ€™s deployment must consider dataset bias and ensure fairness, especially for underrepresented groups. Tools like **IBM AI Fairness 360** help evaluate and mitigate such bias, promoting responsible AI adoption in software engineering.

## ðŸš€ Bonus: Innovation Proposal

### Tool: **AutoDocGen**
- Purpose: Automatically generate docstrings and README files from source code.
- Tech: LLM-based parser integrated into IDE or CI/CD.
- Impact: Saves time, improves collaboration, and promotes documentation best practices.
